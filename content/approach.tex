\subsection{Reinforcement Learning Method and Regression Model} 
\label{ch:approachA}

% TODO: The first section shall describe the reinforcement learning method and regression model you finally implemented, including all crucial design choices. You may also describe approaches you tried and abandoned later, including the reasons.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Our model
	\item Our exploration method
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training process} 
\label{ch:approachB}

% TODO: The second section should describe your training process, including all tricks employed to speed it up (e.g. self play strategy, design of auxilliary rewards, prioritization of experience replay and so on).
\begin{itemize}
	\item Experience buffer
