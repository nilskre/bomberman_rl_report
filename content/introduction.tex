\section{Introduction}

Reinforcement Learning is a part of Machine Learning, where an agent is trained to interact in a desired way with its environment. Based on the current state, the agent decides for an action and can receive a reward for the chosen action. \cite{salvadorReinforcementLearningLiterature2020}

The potential of Reinforcement Learning is proven many times in varying contexts. E.g. attention was generated by the success of DeepMind's AlphaGo, the first artificial agent defeating a human in the game Go. For training this agent they used Reinforcement Learning. \cite{Silver1140}

Salvador, Oliveira and Breternitz have summarized the evolution of Rein\-force\-ment in a literature review \cite{salvadorReinforcementLearningLiterature2020}. They start in 1989 with the publication introducing Q-learning. In the recent past many publications deal with the combination of Deep Learning with Reinforcement Learning. This area is known as Deep-Q-learning.

As part of this project we use Reinforcement Learning for learning how to play Bomberman. Bomberman is a strategic board game, which is played on a field containing walls, crates, bombs, coins and other players. For winning the game one must kill all other players. Typically in a game round first the walls around the player are removed by placing bombs. Next the agent can navigates to his opponents kill them by placing bombs. \cite{Kormelink2018}

After introducing the fundamentals and related work in chapter \ref{fundamentals_related_work}, our approach is described in chapter \ref{approach}. Therefore our selected Reinforcement Learning method and the training process are presented. In chapter \ref{experimental_results} the results of our experiments are described. A conclusion is drawn in chapter \ref{conclusion}.
